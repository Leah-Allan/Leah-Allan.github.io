<h2>Site Info:</h2>

<div id="backstory"></div> <!-- backstory div-->
<br>
<p class="lead"><b>- Website backstory, and why I made it the way I did:</b></p>
I've been making websites for a few years now, both static
html, and with dynamic content management systems like,
Wordpress, Nibble blog, and Anchor CMS. I've also recently
began to work with static site generators like Jekyll, and
Hugo, in which you make a layout template and then you can
just input your content. <br>
And while they are very good at what they do, and honestly a
little more elegant then this site, I wanted to try to make
my own dynamic "static" site solution from scratch. And not
just a template for something like Jekyll.<br>
<br>
This site was created and written by hand, (by me). I used
BBEdit to design the site itself, and SeaMonkey composer to
write out most of the page content. I also used Jqury and
Bootstrap to help aid in the design, and make things look a
little more polished.<br>
<br>
<div id="how"></div> <!-- how div-->
<br>
<p class="lead"><b>- How does this site work?</b></p>
Everything you see on this website (all the content) is
located in the “pages” folder, with the header, navigation
bar, and footer, being located in “layout-components.html”
in the “resources” folder.<br>
<br>
The only page that has the layout is the “index.html” page
in the main folder this is the page where everything gets
loaded to via a Jquery script located in “main.js”.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The Jquery script looks for a specific url event (“?page=“)
and when it see’s an event that matches part of the script,
it loads that specific page into the "dynamic-content" div
on the index page. The same thing happens with the header,
navigation bar, and footer. Only they are loaded by default
on page load.<br>
<br>
If there is an unrecognized url event the script will just
bounce you back to the home page.<br>
<br>
Each of the pages in the page folder, has a “content” div in
which the raw page content is placed into. And it is what
the Jquery load script looks for when fetching the page
content. It will only display what is in that div.<br>
<br>
On the content pages, I put some basic inline CSS in the
pages, that hides the page content, and a redirect that will
redirect them to the correct page id on the index, as I
didn’t want people to see the raw page contents by mistake
if they somehow found their way to the pages folder. (Same
thing with the page-components file).<br>
<br>
So the only page you ever really see is the “index.html”
page in the main directory. Just with dynamic content.<br>
<br>
As a result of using raw html content pages with a standard
layout, this site is very fast and easy to update.<br>
All that has to be done is make a new content page in the
pages folder, then make a few quick updates to the “main.js”
file to add it to the site, then just link the pages url id
wherever you see fit.<br>
<br>
There is also the possibility of having multiple different
site layouts that the content could be loaded into..<br>
Of course the something like Jekyll could do all of this
with ease and be even simpler…. Buuuuut,&nbsp; I wanted to
make something of my own creation.. <br>
<br>
<div id="conclusion"></div> <!-- Conclusion div-->
<br>
<p class="lead"><b>- In Conclusion:</b></p>
This was an interesting learning experience for me, as
I took a leap into JS script and Jquery.. I am really more
proficient in front end design using CSS and making websites
look nice.<br>
I hope you found this site interesting to look through, and who knows,
maybe you’ll be able to learn something and get something
out of this too.<br>
<br>
Thanks for reading!
