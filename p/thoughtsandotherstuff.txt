#3 - 19-06-2019 - Love, compassion, and understanding.
--------------------------

I recently read an account from someone online who thought suicide was effectively pointless, because there are so many opportunities and possibilities that there should be no excuse for someone not to find their niche in life.
They continued on to say that if you kill yourself knowing what it will do to those around you, you are basically a selfish fuck. And that they have no compassion or empathy for you.

And I’d have to say while their are a lot of opportunities and possibilities out there it still is all effectively pointless.
I personally just don’t get a thrill from anything anymore. I know you can chock that up to depression or whatever other label you want to throw at me but your labels effectively mean nothing either. Nothing means anything.
And I never consented to being brought into the world, I never chose to be plopped down on this planet.

Its also great of this person to put actively suicidal people down more.. Because nothing makes you feel better then being reminded what a failure you are, and how selfish you are. (Sarcasm).

I don’t believe the convenience or opportunities in the world are a very compelling reason to live.. In our current firs world time, especially with someone like me living in a first world country, I’m technically surrounded by opportunities..
But it doesn’t make me any happier.
Sure, you could call me a selfish fuck, for having opportunity and throwing it away, but it really is no different from looks or money to me.
None of it makes me feel any better.
 
So I find myself often wondering “So what does mean “something”?”.

Well as I said above technically nothing, so knowing that nothing really matters why do we make life so shitty and why do we take it so seriously?

I think life is just a goofy game, or as Bill Hicks once put it, its a ride.

We need to stop taking shit so seriously and treating it like a big competition.
We need to show love and compassion to one another, we need understanding, appreciation, and to feel wanted and valued.

There are a lot of people out there who are not getting their fundamental needs met, the needs at the very core of their being. No amount of societal convenience or opportunity can fix that.. We need to reach out and lend each other a helping hand. 

I’ve been in and out of psychiatric hospitals more times then I can count at this point.. Every time I’ve gone, they focus on crisis stabilization but they never really touch on what led you there in the first place.
They never really address the issues at the core of your soul.

All they ever do is give you some benzos, and a sheet of resources upon discharge..  
This approach is so flawed.

Sure, I may have chronic mental health issues which are unlikely to ever go away.
But I think a little bit more understanding, love, and compassion would go along way.. Even for people like me who may be considered lost causes by some.

The world can just be so cold.
Sometimes I even question how “mentally ill” I actually am. I wonder if its just a label/box that society has placed me in.
I sometimes wonder if its just my reaction to seeing the world..
The internet has given us almost an omnipresent era, where we can see a lot more then we ever could’ve dreamed in the past. And with all the good of free flowing information comes a lot of bad, we get to see the worst of what society and people bring into the world.

I’m not saying love, and compassion will fix everything. But you can’t deny that they wouldn’t go along way.
And these are things we have currently within our power to show and make change for the better.

We may not be able to fix bad genetics, but we can try to change our actions to be the better people for everyone and everything sake.


This is just a half baked thought, nothing more.. Nothing about this document is really well written its just me thinking in the moment. For the record.

#2 - 18-06-2019 - Love VS Lust. 
--------------------------

For awhile I’ve been talking to a guy on and off online for the last while.. There was a lot of drama a year or so ago with him and me online..
Living in different countries helps as I will most likely never meet him..

I’ve really only started talking to him again on and off, because I am just so lonely.

Anyway he always tells me how “beautiful and amazing” he thinks I am, and how much he loves me and wants to kiss me, how he wishes we were in the same country.. etc, etc…

You get the point.

However I don’t think he sees me for who I actually am.. He just sees me as someone he finds physically attractive without seeing who I am underneath the hair and makeup…
 I don’t think he really loves me, I have a feeling he just feels lust for me and he may not even realize it, So I don’t blame him.. 
I think, he thinks he’s in love but I don’t think thats what it actually is.

I’ve slowed contact down unintentionally, just because I don’t physically have the energy anymore to keep or maintain friendships never mind a romantic one.

#1 - 18-06-2019 - Wage slavery. 
--------------------------

We waste so much of our lives in school, then we waste nearly the rest of our lives in work, that most people hate anyways.

And I often find myself wondering why?

Why do we work for the majority of our lives?
If life is so great and is such a gift shouldn’t we spend it in ways that give us pleasure?
Rather then wasting it all doing work we hate, only to spend two weeks out of the year by a pool taking pictures to send back and gloat to people you hate anyways?

The only reason any of us really work though is because we need money to survive. Over all these billions of years of evolution humans have not changed a bit.
We’ve changed how we play the game, but the game itself is still the same.

This entire life just seems like a rat race to acquire more: possessions, status, “wealth”, and whatever else.

It all just feels so childish to me, it just reminds me of kids playing, and one kid says: “I have more toys then you!”. It doesn’t appeal to me.
And to be quite frank I don’t give a shit anymore who or what has more stuff then I do.

I just get tired of always feeling like a slave to something, always being dependent on one thing or another, and never having a real way of escaping it (aside from death)..

I get tired of always having to dish out money that I don’t have, everywhere..

I understand how capitalism works.. I understand that people need to work in a capitalist system, and I understand capitalism is currently the best economic system we have at the moment. All others may look good on paper but fail in the real world.
I could say more about this but I don’t care to at the moment..

Everything you own, everything you are is on loan to you.
When you die you loose it all..
Regardless of if your some homeless crack head, or a multimillionaire you can’t take it with you.

Why even bother?

At this point I’ve started comparing post secondary education to breast implants.
You may think thats a far fetched comparison, but its really not.
Because your Knowledge, just like your appearance is on loan to you..
You can’t take your education and knowledge with you when you die just as you can’t take your fake tits with you either.

Regardless if you choose to get implants or a degree, they are both of no significance in the grand scheme of things in the universe as a whole.
And at least with huge fake tits you have a chance of sleeping your way to the top anyway lol.. Just kidding.. Maybe..

People around me always want me to get better but if this is what “getting better” looks like I think I’ll just pass.
I’m not anyone's slave, I’m not anyone's bitch.

I refuse to spend the rest of my life working in a shitty dead end job, only to live pay cheque to pay cheque, and acquire more useless possessions along the way that I never really needed to begin with.

I’ve been tempted for along time just to ditch everything and go as off grid as I possibly can.
But eh.. It doesn’t matter at this point anyway.
