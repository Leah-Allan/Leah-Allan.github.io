#2 - 18-06-2019 - Love VS Lust. 
--------------------------

For awhile I’ve been talking to a guy on and off online for the last while.. There was a lot of drama a year or so ago with him and me online..
Living in different countries helps as I will most likely never meet him..

I’ve really only started talking to him again on and off, because I am just so lonely.

Anyway he always tells me how “beautiful and amazing” he thinks I am, and how much he loves me and wants to kiss me, how he wishes we were in the same country.. etc, etc…

You get the point.

However I don’t think he sees me for who I actually am.. He just sees me as someone he finds physically attractive without seeing who I am underneath the hair and makeup…
 I don’t think he really loves me, I have a feeling he just feels lust for me and he may not even realize it, So I don’t blame him.. 
I think, he thinks he’s in love but I don’t think thats what it actually is.

I’ve slowed contact down unintentionally, just because I don’t physically have the energy anymore to keep or maintain friendships never mind a romantic one.

#1 - 18-06-2019 - Wage slavery. 
--------------------------

We waste so much of our lives in school, then we waste nearly the rest of our lives in work, that most people hate anyways.

And I often find myself wondering why?

Why do we work for the majority of our lives?
If life is so great and is such a gift shouldn’t we spend it in ways that give us pleasure?
Rather then wasting it all doing work we hate, only to spend two weeks out of the year by a pool taking pictures to send back and gloat to people you hate anyways?

The only reason any of us really work though is because we need money to survive. Over all these billions of years of evolution humans have not changed a bit.
We’ve changed how we play the game, but the game itself is still the same.

This entire life just seems like a rat race to acquire more: possessions, status, “wealth”, and whatever else.

It all just feels so childish to me, it just reminds me of kids playing, and one kid says: “I have more toys then you!”. It doesn’t appeal to me.
And to be quite frank I don’t give a shit anymore who or what has more stuff then I do.

I just get tired of always feeling like a slave to something, always being dependent on one thing or another, and never having a real way of escaping it (aside from death)..

I get tired of always having to dish out money that I don’t have, everywhere..

I understand how capitalism works.. I understand that people need to work in a capitalist system, and I understand capitalism is currently the best economic system we have at the moment. All others may look good on paper but fail in the real world.
I could say more about this but I don’t care to at the moment..

Everything you own, everything you are is on loan to you.
When you die you loose it all..
Regardless of if your some homeless crack head, or a multimillionaire you can’t take it with you.

Why even bother?

At this point I’ve started comparing post secondary education to breast implants.
You may think thats a far fetched comparison, but its really not.
Because your Knowledge, just like your appearance is on loan to you..
You can’t take your education and knowledge with you when you die just as you can’t take your fake tits with you either.

Regardless if you choose to get implants or a degree, they are both of no significance in the grand scheme of things in the universe as a whole.
And at least with huge fake tits you have a chance of sleeping your way to the top anyway lol.. Just kidding.. Maybe..

People around me always want me to get better but if this is what “getting better” looks like I think I’ll just pass.
I’m not anyone's slave, I’m not anyone's bitch.

I refuse to spend the rest of my life working in a shitty dead end job, only to live pay cheque to pay cheque, and acquire more useless possessions along the way that I never really needed to begin with.

I’ve been tempted for along time just to ditch everything and go as off grid as I possibly can.
But eh.. It doesn’t matter at this point anyway.

This is just a stupid text document I made so I could just journal random shit.
I know.. I couldn't even be bothered to make an html, or jekyll page because I'm a lazy piece of shit.
