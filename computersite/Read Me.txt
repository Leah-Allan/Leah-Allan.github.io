Hi,

Please note, that due to the use of Jquery, this website needs to be run in a local server environment like "Mamp", "Wamp", or on an actual web server.
If you just try to open this on your computer in this folder, nothing will work.

If you don't want to go to the trouble of setting up a local server, you can view the site here: https://leahallan.com/computersite  I have hosted it on my web server.

Thanks.
Leah.
